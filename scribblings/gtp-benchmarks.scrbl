GTP = gradual typing performance

Latest Version: @hyperlink["https://github.com/bennn/gtp-benchmarks/releases"]{@package-version[]}

Source: @url{https://github.com/bennn/gtp-benchmarks}

This package contains benchmarks for measuring the cost of typed/untyped
 interaction in Typed Racket.

@bold{Always include a version number when reporting data on these benchmarks.}

@section[#:tag "gtp:api"]{Running a benchmark}

To run a benchmark:

@itemlist[
@item{
  Create a new directory relative to the benchmark's @filepath{base/} folder (if it exists)
}
@item{
  Copy the benchmark's @filepath{both/} folder into the new directory
}
@item{
  Copy your favorite mix of @filepath{typed/} and @filepath{untyped/} modules into the new directory
}
@item{
  Run the @filepath{main.rkt} module
}
]

@defmodule[gtp-benchmarks/utilities/make-configurations]{
  Script for generating all typed/untyped configurations of a benchmark.
}

@defproc[(make-configurations [dir (and/c path-string? directory-exists?)]) void?]{
  Given a path to a benchmark (under the @filepath{benchmarks/} directory),
   generates all typed/untyped configurations of the benchmark and stores
   them in a new folder in the current directory.

                   between the untyped and typed versions. (It would be good

                   This issue seriously affects the conclusion about @bm{zordoz}

                   That paper compares one version of @bm{zordoz} that does not
                    suffer the issue (6.2) against two that do (6.3 and 6.4),
                    and incorrectly concludes that changes to Typed Racket
                    improved the overhead in the later versions.
                   In fact, the overhead is better because the untyped code
                    got unnecessarily slower.

                   The @bm{quadMB} benchmark integrated these two programs;
                    this was a @bold{BAD} decision, because the typed version performed significantly different computations due to uses of @racket[cast] and @racket[define-predicate].
                   The @bm{quadBG} benchmark added types to the untyped program (with minimal changes to the code).

@section[#:tag "gtp:descriptions"]{Benchmark Descriptions}

This section has summaries of the benchmark programs.

In each description, the @emph{author} and @emph{source} fields credit the
 authors of the code that inspired the benchmarks.
The @emph{dependencies} field lists any libraries outside the core of Racket
 and Typed Racket that the benchmarks use; we assume that programmers who
 use gradual typing cannot change the language of these libraries (the libraries
 are either typed or untyped).

Each benchmark comes with a short description of its behavior,
 a module dependence graph,
 and the names of its @emph{migratable} and @emph{fixed} modules.
In the module graphs, edges point from one module to another whenever one
 module requires another.
Nodes for migratable modules are circles --- these are the modules we apply
 gradual typing to.
Nodes for fixed modules are squares --- these modules are the same in all
 configurations.

Note: these graphs do not show @emph{type adaptor modules}.

@section{Static Benchmark Details}

@subsection{Benchmark Size}

@figure["fig:static-summary" @elem{Size of the benchmarks.}
  @tabulate-gradual-typing-benchmarks-size[]]

The table in @figure-ref{fig:static-summary} quantifies the benchmarks' size
and structure.
The @emph{Untyped LOC} column lists the number of non-whitespace, non-comment lines of
code in the untyped version of each benchmark (computed by the @hyperlink["https://github.com/AlexKnauth/syntax-sloc"]{@tt{syntax-sloc}} library).
The @emph{Annotation LOC} is the additional number of lines in the typed version
of each benchmark; this estimates the number of type annotations in the typed version.
The @emph{# Modules} column is the number of modules in each benchmark, and
lastly the @emph{# Bnd.} and @emph{# Exp.} columns summarize the dependencies between
these modules.
One boundary (counted in @emph{# Bnd.}) is one import statement from one module
in the benchmark to another.
One export (counted in @emph{# Exp.}) is one identifier provided by one module
in the benchmark.


@subsection{Benchmark Types}

This section contains the source code for each boundary between modules in
 the benchmarks.
The data format is:

@nested[#:style 'inset
  @list[@bold{benchmark name}
        @linebreak[]
        @emph{importing module}
        @linebreak[]
        @verbatim{'(require-typed-check exporting-module ...)}]]

In other words, the data below shows the @racket[require/typed/check] forms
 for each module in each benchmark.

Depending on the configuration, a @racket[require/typed/check] expands to
 either a @racket[require] or a @racket[require/typed] form.
The latter form compiles types to contracts; these contracts are the reason
 why some configurations run slower than others.
In this way, the types below give an idea of the kind of overhead each benchmark
 may suffer from.

Note: the data below may refer to type aliases.
See the source code for each benchmark to find what the aliases stand for.

@format-require-typed-check-info[]



@section{Dynamic Benchmark Details}
@; TODO (theoretical) worst-case performance [[contract profile]]
@; TODO `raco expand` output of worst-case versions (for the contracts)

This section reports low-level details about the execution of the
 @deftech[#:key "twc"]{theoretical worst-case configuration} (for short: @tech{TWC}) of each benchmark.
The @tech{TWC} configuration is the one in which every boundary between
 migratable modules is guarded by a contract.
In Typed Racket terms, this means every import between migratable modules is
 via @racket[require/typed].
(This configuration has worse performance than any configuration that
 combines typed and untyped modules --- because in those real configurations,
 only some of the boundaries are guarded with contracts.)

The data in this section was obtained by running a version of Racket v6.12
 instrumented with compiler-level counters to track chaperone use.
The patch implementing the counters is part of this repository's source code,
 and is adapted from a patch by @hyperlink["http://cs.brown.edu/~sstrickl/chaperones/"]{Strickland, Tobin-Hochstadt, Findler, and Flatt (2012)}.


@subsection{Time and Garbage Collection Details}

The data in @figure-ref{fig:dynamic-time} comes from calling @racket[vector-set-performance-stats!]
 after running the @tech{TWC} configuration.
Column @emph{Milliseconds} column reports total running time (including setup, i.e., reading from data files) in milliseconds.
Column @emph{GC Milliseconds} column reports the total garbage collection time.
Column @emph{Num. GC} reports the number of garbage collections performed since start-up in the current place.
Column @emph{Peak Bytes} reports the largest number of bytes that were allocated just before a garbage collection.


@figure["fig:dynamic-time" @elem{@tech{TWC} Time Details}
  @format-time-info[]]


@subsection{Chaperones Details}

The data in @figure-ref{fig:dynamic-chaperones} reports low-level details about chaperones.

Quick reference:

@itemlist[
@item{@emph{Proc.} = procedure chaperone}
@item{@emph{Struct} = struct chaperone}
@item{@emph{Vec} = vector chaperone}
@item{@emph{apps} = applications and reads}
@item{@emph{makes} = allocations}
@item{@emph{depth} = layers of chaperones}
]

In more detail:
 @emph{Proc. apps} counts the number of times the benchmark applies a chapereoned procedure,
 @emph{Struct apps} counts the number of field references or property accesses to chaperoned structs,
 and @emph{Vec. apps} counts the number of references to chaperoned vectors.
The @emph{Proc. makes}, @emph{Struct makes}, and @emph{Vec. makes} columns count
 the number of times each kind of chaperone was created.
Finally, @emph{Proc. depth}, @emph{Struct depth}, and @emph{Vec. depth} report
 the largest number of chaperones layered on top of one value.
For example, if @emph{Proc. depth} is 3 then there is at least one function
 in the benchmark that gets wrapped in three procedure chaperones when the benchmark runs.
